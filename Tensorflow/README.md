## Regularization - Reducing Overfitting
The purpose of adding regularization techniques, is to reduce the model from overfitting. Some techniques used are; reduce model capacity, l2 regularization, dropout, early stopping and data augmentation.
Some of those techniques can be found in:
1. l2 regularization: 4_CNN_functional.py
2. dropout: 4_CNN_functional.py
